# Front door for tests. Inner loop: `just test-fast`. Full suite: `just test`.
# Gates: `just check` at pre-commit, `just gate` at pre-push. The git hooks call
# `hook-pre-commit` and `hook-pre-push`, which run the very same commands under their own
# target names so the report can price the hooks separately from the targets people type.
# Fresh clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to install the hooks.
# Every recipe runs through the vendored timing wrapper `tools/tt` (source of truth:
# ops `bin/tt`), which appends one line per run to the shared timing log.
# Design: ops docs/specs/2026-09-04-test-ci-audit-design.md.

# The three commands, each written once, so a hook can never drift from the gate it
# stands in for. `npm test` rather than the runner directly: package.json stays the one
# definition of what the suite is.
#
# fast_cmd is the same command as test_cmd: `node --test` has no affected-only selection
# and the suite is a second of wall time, so there is nothing finer to select yet. The
# report showing the two targets with equal durations is the truth, not a gap to close.

# What the pre-commit hook runs: `check`'s command under its own hook target.

# What the pre-push hook runs: the same commands as `gate`, under one hook target.
